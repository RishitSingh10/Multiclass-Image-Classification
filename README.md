# Multiclass-Image-Classification
Classification of food images from 101 classes using EfficientNetB0.
Dataset used is Food101 dataset.
The aim of this project is to build a model which beats the baseline DeepFood, a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.
